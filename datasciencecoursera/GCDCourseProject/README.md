- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- The mean of either a mean or std measurement from the original dataset.

The dataset includes the following files:

Course Project files

- 'README.md'

- 'CodeBook.md': Describes the variables included in the dataset.

- 'run_analysis.R': R code that takes as an input the UCI HAR dataset, and cleans and manipulates the data to produce 'tidy_data.txt' tidy dataset.

Notes:

- Tidy data is is 'wide' format
